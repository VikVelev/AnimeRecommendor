# MovieRecommendor
!!! In the process of migrating to tensorflow !!!
Recommend anime, movies, tv shows based on your taste.
Did this as an introduction to Machine Learning 
```python
print("Hello AI!")
```
# Dependencies (Python libraries)
```
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn
```
# Usage
```bash
$~ git clone https://github.com/VikVelev/AnimeRecommendor
$~ cd MovieRecommendor
$~ python Anime/main.py
# or
$~ python Movies/main.py
```
Wait for it to load and/or train.
The Anime one is trained and works good.

The Movies one is a whole lot of data and I didn't have the time to let it train properly.
If you do have a decent CPU and a lot of time, feel free to send a pull reqeust.

After loading type a show which you liked.
